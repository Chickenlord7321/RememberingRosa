			<h2>$320.18 Raised </h2>
			<p>
				Doug often used to play the live otter cam from <abbr title="Monterey Bay Aquarium">MBA</abbr> on his 
				streams as an adorable distraction for his audience. During one such stream in 2019, he learned that 
				Rosa was both the world's oldest living sea otter and that her birthday was in only a week's time. So, 
				on her birthday, Doug and his community hosted a small charity stream in which they played otter-related 
				games and donated all the funds raised to Monterey Bay Aquarium. It was only $320.18 that year, but that was only the beginning....

			<h2>$2,676 Raised </h2>

				After such a positive response in 2019, Doug hosted another charity stream for Rosa's birthday the follow&shy;ing year. 
				After setting a stretch goal of $400 plus the $250 Doug was adding out of his own pocket, his Twitch chat exceeded 
				all expectations by raising over two and a half thousand dollars over the course of a 4-hour stream, making sure 
				Rosa got to eat plenty of delicious shrimp cocktails in her retirement!

			<h2>$14,172.92 Raised </h2>
			<p>
				By now, the Rosa's Birthday Celebration event had become not just another funny stream idea in 
				Doug's repertoire, but perhaps his most anticipated stream of the year. The Rosa streams are a 
				compendium of all of Doug's most memorable challenges throughout the year. In a sense, they are 
				a celebration of both Rosa and the community Doug has built. And following the tradition of absolutely 
				smashing their fundraising records each year, Doug's Twitch chat did it again by tripling their previous 
				donation, and then tripling it again.

			<h2>$104,327.89 Raised </h2>
			<p>
				Rosa's 23rd birthday in 2022 was the year the dam broke open completely. The previous year, 
				it took Twitch chat 7 hours to raise around 14 thousand dollars. In 2022, they broke that milestone 
				in 25 minutes. Doug's maximum stretch goal for this year was $25K, which flew by so quickly that 
				he had to keep adding new stretch goals periodically as several thousand online viewers donated 
				<em>one hundred thousand dollars</em> to an otter in retirement who was already living life to 
				the fullest. She <em>is</em> super adorable though, can you blame them?

			<h2>$302,014.21 Raised </h2>
			<p>
				In 2023, the DougDoug community achieved a new high: they beat Google. Not even one of the world's 
				largest tech conglomerates could raise over $300,000 dollars for a sea otter, but thousands of kindhearted 
				people could do it in a single day. Sadly, though it was unknown at the time, this would be the last 
				birthday celebration while Rosa was still with us. But what an end it was! Rosa knew how to throw the 
				greatest birthday parties of all time!

			<h2>$625,375.68 Raised </h2>
			<p>
				After Rosa passed away on June 5, 2024, the Rosa birthday streams became a celebration of Rosa's life and 
				of all her many achievements as the queen of Monterey Bay Aquarium. The DougDoug community made her proud 
				this year by raising <em>well over half a million dollars</em> in her memory. There can be little doubt that 
				Rosa will go down in history as the most beloved otter of all time, so long as Doug and Twitch Chat are 
				there to love and remember her.
