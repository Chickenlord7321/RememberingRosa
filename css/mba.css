to fit on the left-hand side, we have to move it below the image. Finding that exact 
breakpoint is, as far as I know, impossible with CSS. So I have chosen 1060px, because 
that is slightly smaller than a tablet size, so it will still look good on tablets, but 
big enough that the title won't become too tiny and sqished. I'm just hoping it works on 
99% of screens.... */
