		<section>
			<h2>1999 &mdash; 2002</h2>
			<p>
				Rosa was found as an orphaned pup &mdash; only around 4 weeks old &mdash; stranded on a Santa Cruz County 
				beach in September 1999. She was raised at the Aquarium for 7 months before being released back into the wild 
				in April 2000. But 2 years later she returned to the aquarium after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service deemed 
				she was becoming too friendly with humans, which posed a risk to herself and other people. Since then, she has 
				remained at the aquarium as part of <abbr title="Monterey Bay Aquarium">MBA</abbr>'s Sea Otter Program.

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>2003 &mdash; 2018</h2>
			<p>
				Rosa soon became part of MBA's surrogacy program, which pairs orphaned or lost sea otter pups with one of the 
				aquarium's resident moms. Rosa was such a good mom that she eventually became MBA's most experienced surrogate 
				mother, raising 15 pups to adulthood, many of whom have gone on to raise pups of their own in the wild. She 
				retired from the program in 2018.

			<h2>2019 &mdash; 2024</h2>
			<p>
				Doug and his community have raised an unbelievable <em>1 million dollars</em> in total for Rosa and the Monterey 
				Bay Aquarium, making her the world's richest and cutest geriatric otter. We don't know what she did with all of 
				that money, but there has been a suspicious shortage of clams since 2019. Her adorableness and remarkable achievements 
				as a surrogate mother have inspired waves of donations from fans all around the world, including 
				<a href="https://www.dougdoug.com/allcelebratingrosaslife">amazing art pieces</a> created by the DougDoug community on her birthday each year.

			<h2>Rosa's Legacy</h2>
			<p>
				Sadly, after showing worrying signs of age-related health problems that were compromising her quality of life, Monterey Bay Aquarium made 
				<a href="https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/newsroom/press-releases/monterey-bay-aquarium-sea-otter-rosa-has-died" target="_blank" aria-label="Opens in a new tab">the announcement</a> 
				that Rosa had passed away peacefully on June 5, 2024, surrounded by her caretakers. She was 24 years old, making her the second oldest known 
				sea otter to have ever lived. But her memory will be cherished for years to come by the staff at Monterey Bay Aquarium who cared for her all 
				these long years, and by the DougDoug community who came to adore her as their queen.
